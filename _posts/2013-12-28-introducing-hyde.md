Perception Engineer with 7+ years experience in computer vision and robotics. With experience in multiple academic, industrial and government projects owning full perception subsystems for robots from <1k up to 1ton. Participated and owned complete perception stack from perception sensor and compute specification, selection, bring-up and calibration, software architecture and implementation using both classic and learning algorithms, integration with other subsystems (navigation, loco-manipulation) and field deployment, telemetry and monitoring. Familiar with production-quality software engineering, agile development and multi-discipline design particular to robot engineering. 

As a person, I excell at taking ownership, constantly curious and hands-on, always learning and eager to understand our universe and working to have a positive social impact. Through my life and work, I discovered and experienced the power of science and technology to advance humanity. I strongly believe that autonomous robotics and intelligent systems are essential tools to build a better world for all forms of life. I strive to take my life in this direction.
