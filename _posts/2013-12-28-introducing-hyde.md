Perception Engineer with 7+ years experience in computer vision and robotics. With experience in multiple academic, industrial and government projects owning full perception subsystems for robots from <1k up to 1ton. Participated and owned complete perception stack from perception sensor and compute specification, selection, bring-up and calibration, software architecture and implementation using both classic and learning algorithms, integration with other subsystems (navigation, loco-manipulation) and field deployment, telemetry and monitoring. Familiar with production-quality software engineering, agile development and multi-discipline design particular to robot engineering. 

As a person, I excell at taking ownership, constantly curious and hands-on, always learning and eager to understand our universe and working to have a positive social impact. Through my life and work, I discovered and experienced the power of science and technology to advance humanity. I strongly believe that autonomous robotics and intelligent systems are essential tools to build a better world for all forms of life. I strive to take my life in this direction.

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
