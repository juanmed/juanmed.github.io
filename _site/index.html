    <p>Perception Engineer with 7+ years experience in computer vision and robotics. With experience in multiple academic, industrial and government projects owning full perception subsystems for robots from &lt;1k up to 1ton. Participated and owned complete perception stack from perception sensor and compute specification, selection, bring-up and calibration, software architecture and implementation using both classic and learning algorithms, integration with other subsystems (navigation, loco-manipulation) and field deployment, telemetry and monitoring. Familiar with production-quality software engineering, agile development and multi-discipline design particular to robot engineering.</p>

<p>As a person, I excell at taking ownership, constantly curious and hands-on, always learning and eager to understand our universe and working to have a positive social impact. Through my life and work, I discovered and experienced the power of science and technology to advance humanity. I strongly believe that autonomous robotics and intelligent systems are essential tools to build a better world for all forms of life. I strive to take my life in this direction.</p>

      <strong>GTMNIST: Guatemalan handwritting dataset</strong><br /> As part of the vote verification project, I realized the hand writting patterns in the widely used MNIST dataset is biased towards the group that generated the dataset. Although arabic numbers are used throughout the world, each group of people writes and understands them in different manners. This bias resulted in reduced inference accuracy when applied to handwritting from other countries. To address this bias, I created the <a href="https://github.com/juanmed/eleccionesGT2019/tree/master/datasets/gtmnist">first Guatemalan MNIST dataset</a>, which contains more than 6000 sample characters. To the best of my knowledge, such work was not done before. After finetuning OCR networks on this dataset, accuracy improved from 80% to 95%.<br /><em>Personal initiative</em><br />2019 - 2020
